<p>I graduated from <a href='https://www.harvard.edu'>Harvard</a> in December 2021 with a concentration 
  in <a href='https://www.seas.harvard.edu/computer-science'>Computer Science</a> and
  a secondary in <a href='http://www.math.harvard.edu/'>Mathematical Sciences</a>. I am broadly
  interested in programming languages, especially formal verification and security.</p>

<p>Currently, I'm a research assistant in the <a href='https://plv.csail.mit.edu/'>PLV group at MIT</a>, 
  supervised by Prof. <a href='http://adam.chlipala.net/'>Adam Chlipala</a>. I'm working on adding support
  for runtime metrics to the <a href='https://github.com/mit-plv/bedrock2'>Bedrock2</a> compiler, 
  as well as a model checker for the RISC-V memory model.</p>

<p>At Harvard, I worked with Prof. <a href='https://people.seas.harvard.edu/~chong/'>Stephen Chong</a> and
  Dr. <a href='https://basus.me/'>Shrutarshi Basu</a> on verified compilation.

<p>In summer 2019, I worked with Prof. <a href='https://kcsrk.info/'>KC Sivaramakrishnan</a> at IIT
  Madras on adding sublinear algorithms to the <a href='https://ocaml.xyz'>Owl library</a> for
  numerical and scientific computing in OCaml. Check out my <a
    href='/ocaml/owl/count-min-sketch/sublinear-algorithms/countmin-sketch/'>blog post</a> about it
  for more.
