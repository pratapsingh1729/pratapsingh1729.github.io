For my final project in [CS252r: Advanced Topics in Programming Languages]('https://canvas.harvard.edu/courses/82977') in Spring 2021, I worked with Dr. [Anitha Gollamudi](https://scholar.harvard.edu/anithag/home) on developing simplified proofs of strong normalization for complex calculi in the [lambda cube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_cube). Primarily, we focused on System F, which adds polymorphism to the simply-typed lambda calculus, and LF, which adds dependent types. We based our proofs on those developed by Sørensen and Urzyczyn[^1], but we simplified and modified their presentation to make the proofs more digestible.

Check out my [project writeup](/assets/pdf/PratapSingh_CS252r_final_project.pdf) to see the proofs.
